### Development of a Framework for managing digital workflows online

The effective management of processes in universities is critical for their success and digital
workflows offer a means to automate, optimize, and streamline these processes. However, the
implementation of digitalworkflows in universities faces several challenges, including the complexity
of the processes involved, the need for interdepartmental collaboration and communication,
and the need to balance efficiency with transparency and accountability. To address
these challenges, this thesis proposes the development of a framework for managing digital
workflows processes online for the universities. The framework is designed to be generic and
adaptable, making it applicable to a wide range of universities and processes. The framework
includes components such as process modeling, process execution, process monitoring and
control, and process improvement. The framework enables university Admins and Leaders
to create custom processes, assign responsibilities to different department users manage steps
within the processes. The thesis also provides a detailed analysis of the requirements and challenges
of managing digital workflows in universities and evaluates the proposed framework
through a case study. The results show that the proposed framework is capable of effectively
managing digital workflows in universities, taking into account the unique requirements and
challenges of this context. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the potential impact and
benefits of the framework for organizations and industries, as well as recommendations for
future research and development.
